This is the Etch-A-Sketch Project for The Odin Project

This was an interesting project. I had some JavaScript knowledge, but haven't 
made any fun projects with it recently. Getting the flex grid to work and not spill over
was challenging but fun. I initially had some problems with my math, rather than my code, 
which caused some confusion. After figuring out the intial problem, I opted to go for 
a bit of a fun color design to look a bit like the original etch a sketch.

I decided to go for the bonus challenge for fun, and went with a palette of 5 colors
to be applied randomly as the user hovers over the squares. The colors will be saved and become
gradually more opaque as the user hovers over the same cells again.

All in all this was a fun challenge and helped me understand how to format flex a bit better.

I continue to struggle with granular commits, but I will get there.
I keep reminding myself to do it and I think I am doing better than before.
There is still a way to go for me though.
